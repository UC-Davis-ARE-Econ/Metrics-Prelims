# Metrics-Prelims
Repository for past UC Davis ARE/Econ econometrics prelim exams and student-generated answer keys. 

## Purpose of Repository
In an effort to create more open access to the past econometrics prelims, this repository provides a public location for past exams to be hosted, for students to discuss exams, and for student-generated answer keys to be submitted. 

The hope is that it will be easier to access a single, public location than constantly sharing different Dropbox, Google Drive, or other folders that are more difficult to access.
